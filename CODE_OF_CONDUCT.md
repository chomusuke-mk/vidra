# Vidra Community Code of Conduct

We want Vidra to remain a focused, welcoming collaboration space. The rules below apply to every interaction related to the project—issues, pull requests, discussions, chats, and live events hosted by chomusuke.dev.

## Core Principles
- **Respect** – Debate ideas, never people. Assume positive intent and keep discussions professional.
- **Clarity** – Communicate in English, stay on topic, and provide actionable context when reporting bugs or proposing features.
- **Inclusivity** – No harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind. Accessibility feedback is always welcome.
- **Stewardship** – Remember that Vidra is source-available, not open-source. Help newcomers understand the license and third-party requirements.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Threats, sexualized language or imagery, doxxing, or sustained disruption of threads.
- Sharing confidential or security-sensitive information outside the channels designated by chomusuke.dev.
- Advertising unrelated products, spamming automated content, or encouraging unauthorized forks/distribution of Vidra.

## Reporting & Enforcement
- If you witness or experience a violation, email **7k9mc4urn@mozmail.com** with as much detail as possible (links, screenshots, timestamps).
- chomusuke.dev may remove content, mute participants, temporarily suspend access, or permanently ban accounts that disregard this code.
- Appeals can be submitted to the same email with the subject line `Conduct Appeal`.

Thanks for helping us maintain a productive, modern collaboration environment.
